# D3: Token Merging

# Game Design Vision

A website that tracks your location if you use it on your phone to navigate a map of the world (can also navigate using controls and not a map). You can pick up tokens in various locations and keep them with you before combining them with other tokens you find in other squares.

# Technologies

- TypeScript for most game code, little to no explicit HTML, and all CSS collected in common `style.css` file
- Deno and Vite for building
- GitHub Actions + GitHub Pages for deployment automation

# Assignments

## D3.a: Core mechanics (token collection and crafting)

Key technical challenge: Can you assemble a map-based user interface using the Leaflet mapping framework?
Key gameplay challenge: Can players collect and craft tokens from nearby locations to finally make one of sufficiently high value?

### Steps

- [x] copy main.ts to reference.ts for future reference
- [x] delete everything in main.ts
- [x] put a basic leaflet map on the screen
- [ ] draw the player's location on the map
- [ ] draw a rectangle representing one cell on the map
- [ ] use loops to draw a whole grid of cells on the map

## D3.b: Fill in once I get here
